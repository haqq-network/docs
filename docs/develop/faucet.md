### Web

To prevent the faucet account from draining the available funds, the Haqq TestEdge2 faucet imposes a maximum number of requests for a given period of time. By default, the faucet service accepts only one request per day per address. You can request ISLM from the faucet for each address only once every 24 hours. If you try to request multiple times within the 24-hour cooldown phase, no transaction will be initiated. Please try again in 24 hours.

### Discord / Telegram

You can request ISLM from the faucet only once every hour. If you try to request multiple times within the one-hour cooldown period, no transaction will be initiated. Please try again in one hour.

## Amount

For each request, the faucet transfers 1,000 ISLM on the `Web` and 10 ISLM on `Telegram` and `Discord` to the specified address.
