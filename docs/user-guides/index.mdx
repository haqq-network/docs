# Overview

:::note Learn about validating on <ProjectValue keyword="name"/>
:::

## Introduction

HAQQ Network is based on [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft), which relies on a set of validators that are responsible for committing new blocks in the blockchain. These validators participate in the consensus protocol by broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by each validator's private key.

Validator candidates can bond their own staking tokens and have the tokens "delegated", or staked, to them by token holders. The **<ProjectValue keyword="denom" />** is <ProjectValue keyword="short_name"/>'s native token. At its onset, <ProjectValue keyword="short_name"/> will launch with 150 validators. The validators are determined by who has the most stake delegated to them â€” the top 150 validator candidates with the most stake will become <ProjectValue keyword="short_name"/> validators.

Validators and their delegators will earn <ProjectValue keyword="denom" />s as block provisions and tokens as transaction fees through execution of the <ProjectValue keyword="consensus"/> consensus protocol. Initially, transaction fees will be paid in Photons but in the future, any token in the Cosmos ecosystem will be valid as fee tender if it is whitelisted by governance. Note that validators can set commission on the fees their delegators receive as additional incentive.

If validators double sign, are frequently offline or do not participate in governance, their staked <ProjectValue keyword="denom" />s (including <ProjectValue keyword="denom" />s of users that delegated to them) can be slashed. The penalty depends on the severity of the violation.

## Get Involved

Set up a dedicated validator's website, social profile (eg: Twitter) and signal your intention to become a validator on Discord. This is important since delegators will want to have information about the entity they are delegating their ISLMs to.

## Seek Legal Advice

Seek legal advice if you intend to run a validator.
