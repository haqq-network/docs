# Keplr

Connect your Keplr wallet with <ProjectValue keyword="name" />.

- [Install Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/)

![keplr-homepage.png](/img/keplr-homepage.png)

:::note
The Keplr extension is officially supported on Chromium-based browsers (i.e. Edge, Chrome, and Brave) and Firefox.
:::

The [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) browser extension is a wallet for accessing applications in the Cosmos ecosystem and
managing user identities. It can be used to connect to <ProjectValue keyword="name" /> mainnet and testnet and claim
rewards, send and stake tokens, interact with governance, and more.

## Set Up Keplr

:::note
Further information about the process of setting up Keplr can be found in the official
[Keplr Documentation](https://keplr.crunch.help/getting-started) or in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/chainapsis/how-to-use-keplr-wallet-40afc80907f6).
:::

Open the Keplr extension on your browser. If you are setting up Keplr for the first time, you can either
[create a new account](#create-a-new-account) or [import an existing account](#import-an-existing-account).

## Connect Keplr to HAQQ

Once you are signed in to the Keplr extension, you can connect the wallet with the HAQQ network. The HAQQ mainnet network
is already built into Keplr and look for the `HAQQ` network by clicking on the extension and scrolling to select the network.

:::note
if you already have a configured wallet, you can click on one of the two buttons below to add the network you need

### Create a New Account

There are several ways to create a new account:

- via a [mnemonic/seed phrase](#create-a-wallet-with-a-seed-phrase)
- via [one-click login](#create-an-account-with-one-click-google-oauth-login)

#### Create a Wallet with a Seed Phrase

![keplr-create-new.png](/img/keplr-create-new.png)

1. In the initial pop-up window, choose **Create New Wallet**

2. In the next window, choose **Create new recovery phrase**

3. Choose to have a seed/mnemonic phrase of 12 or 24 words, copy, save the phrase and click **Next**

- You can change the derivation path by clicking on **Advanced**, but this is optional (learn more in the
  [Keplr FAQ](https://faq.keplr.app/))

4. Verify your seed/mnemonic phrase by filling the form word fields according to their numbers

5. Enter a name for your account (you can change later)

6. Set a strong password, repeat it and press **Next**

7. In last window, our network is not included in the list of integrated networks within the wallet. In the meantime, you can select the networks that you find useful for yourself from the list of available networks and click **Save**

:::note Note
Currently, our network is not included in the list of integrated networks within the wallet.
However, please note that we are actively working towards integration and aim to be included as soon as possible.

#### Create an Account with One-Click (Google OAuth) Login

:::note
It is suggested to create an account via mnemonic phrase or utilize a Ledger and not use the `Sign in with Google`.
:::

1. Choose the option **Sign in with Google**
2. Now enter the email/phone number associated with your Google account, the password, and click **Next**
3. If you have not used Keplr before, set a **strong** password for the Keplr extension, and click **Confirm**

### Import an Existing Account

There are several ways to import an existing account:

- via a [mnemonic/seed phrase/private key](#import-an-account-with-a-seed-phrase)
- via [ledger](#import-an-account-with-a-ledger)

#### Import an Account with a Seed Phrase

1. In the initial pop-up window, choose **Import Existing Account**

- If you have used Keplr before, click on the **Import an existing wallet**, and select **Use recovery phrase or private key**
  ![keplr-import-existing.png](/img/keplr-import-existing.png)

2. Enter your mnemonic/seed phrase/private key in the appropriate slot, separating the words with spaces and taking
   care to check they are spelled correctly
   ![keplr-seed-phrase.png](/img/keplr-seed-phrase.png)
3. Make sure you have imported the account with the correct derivation path, viewable by clicking on **Advanced**

- Normally, the derivation path should be `m/44'/…’/0/0/0`, but if you see that importing the account via
  mnemonic on Keplr, the Cosmos Mainnet address displayed is different than yours, it is possible the derivation
  path ends with 1 (or another number) instead of 0
- If this is the case, you just have to start the process over, and replace the last 0 with 1
- Learn more in the [Keplr FAQ](https://faq.keplr.app/)

4. If you have not used Keplr before, set a **strong** password for the Keplr extension, and click **Confirm**

#### Import an Account with a Ledger

![kepler-import-ledger.png](/img/kepler-import-ledger.png)

1. In the initial pop-up window, choose **Import Ledger**

- If you have used Keplr before, click on the silhouette in the upper-right corner, then the blue box labeled
  **Add Account**, and select **Import Ledger**
- Be sure you have both the Cosmos and Ethereum Ledger apps downloaded on your Ledger device

2. To complete the connection with your Ledger device, follow the steps described in the pop-up that appears (a detailed
   tutorial can be found [here](https://medium.com/chainapsis/how-to-use-ledger-nano-hardware-wallet-with-keplr-9ea7f07826c2))
   or another article from a [validator](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-set-up-ledger-wallet-evmos-using-keplr-c438cf8c5321).
3. If you have not used Keplr before, set a **strong** password for the Keplr extension, and click **Confirm**
4. Switch to the Ethereum app on the Ledger, then select “HAQQ” from the Keplr chain registry to connect the public key

- All signing from Keplr will use the Ledger Ethereum app, with either [EIP-712 transactions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712)
  or standard [Ethereum transactions](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/).

## Changing RPC/REST on Keplr Wallet

There are times when the wallet's connected RPC or REST is not working and requires an update. Check the
[networks list](../../develop/api/networks) for endpoints to use. To change the configuration, follow these steps:

1. Click on the Keplr Wallet Extension
2. Go to `Settings` and go to `Endpoints`
3. Make sure you are on the `HAQQ Testnet` network from the dropdown. Testnet networks will likely be towards the bottom
   of the list.
4. Update either the `RPC` or `REST` or both inputs and click `Confirm`

<!-- ## Connect to HAQQ Testnet

![keplr-testnet-evmos.png](/img/keplr-testnet-evmos.png)

The default network configurations for Keplr comes with mainnet as its default. To connect to the testnet environment,
you will need to head to a site/project that has testnet configuration. A window will request your approval for the chain
and the `chain-id`. Once approved, the testnet will be selectable under the `Beta Support` section of Keplr Wallet.

:::note
Add HAQQ Testnet to Keplr.
