# Wallet Overview

HAQQ Network supports both Cosmos and ERC-20 coins. There are several wallets that work with the network. Some of these wallets support Ledger connectivity. Consult the table below for more information. We recommend official HAQQ Wallet, Metamask and Keplr wallets. These three wallets also work with the Ledger. For more information about Ledger, proceed to [here](./connect-your-wallet/ledger).
