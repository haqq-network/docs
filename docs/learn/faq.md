<summary><b>For certain wallets, I see both bech32 and hex while others only show hex formatted addresses, which should
 I use?</b></summary>

The HAQQ Network supports both formats: bech32 and hex. Other EVM peers and its ecosystem uses hex encoding while
Cosmos-native uses bech32 formatted addresses. Keplr is unique and the EVM-compatible chains shows both formats. If you
are sending tokens (via IBC), you will use bech32 formatted addresses unless
the receiving chain support EVM (i.e. Ethermint-based chains).
