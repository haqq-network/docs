# What is HAQQ

## Overview

HAQQ Network is a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake blockchain that is fully compatible and
interoperable with Ethereum. It's built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/) which runs on top
of [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft) consensus engine.

HAQQ allows for running vanilla Ethereum as a [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/)
application-specific blockchain. This allows developers to have all the desired features of
Ethereum, while at the same time, benefit from CometBFT’s PoS implementation. Also, because it is
built on top of the Cosmos SDK, it will be able to exchange value with the rest of the Cosmos
Ecosystem through the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).

## Features

Here’s a glance at some of the key features of HAQQ:

- Web3 and EVM compatibility
- High throughput via [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft)
- Horizontal scalability via [IBC](https://cosmos.network/ibc)
- Fast transaction finality

HAQQ enables these key features by:

- Implementing CometBFT's Application Blockchain Interface ([ABCI](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/abci/)) to manage the blockchain
- Leveraging [modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/building-modules/intro.html) and other mechanisms implemented by the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/).
- Utilizing [`geth`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) as a library to avoid code reuse and improve maintainability.
- Exposing a fully compatible Web3 [JSON-RPC](../develop/api/ethereum-json-rpc) layer for interacting with existing Ethereum clients and tooling (eg, [Metamask](../user-guides/connect-your-wallet/Metamask)).

The sum of these features allows developers to leverage existing Ethereum ecosystem tooling and
software to seamlessly deploy smart contracts which interact with the rest of the Cosmos
[ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem)!
